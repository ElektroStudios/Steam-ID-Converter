# Steam ID Converter

### Simple tool to convert between SteamID32 and SteamID64 (account number) identifiers

------------------

## 👋 Introduction

Steam ID Converter is a desktop application for Windows, that lets you convert between SteamID32 and SteamID64 identifiers.

Note: This program works for identifiers of an account number. This program does not work to identify the type and the domain (universe) of an Steam ID.

More info about the Steam ID structure: [SteamID wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamID)

## 📋 Features

 - Automatically detects the format of the input SteamID value and then performs the conversion.
 - Can convert a SteamID32 to SteamID64.
 - Can convert a SteamID64 to SteamID32.
 - Supports hexadecimal values.

## 👌 Use cases

Getting a SteamID32 or SteamID64 in the correct format can be quite useful. For instance, it allows you to use a savegame from another user in a video game. It can also be employed to set the correct SteamID value in configuration files commonly associated with pirated video game cracks, such as `codex.ini`, `CPY.ini`, `ds.ini`, `REVOLT.ini`, `steam_api.ini`, `steam_emu.ini`, `tenoke.ini` and others, which expects to specify an SteamID32 or SteamID64 in the right format.
